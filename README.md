# Interesting Software Engineering Article - Shubhi Upadhyay

An article I found interesting was a New York Times article about how AI is going to change the way the programming occurs. 
It's titled [Itâ€™s the End of Computer Programming as We Know It. \(And I Feel Fine.\)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/opinion/ai-coding.html?searchResultPosition=14). 
What I found interesting about the article is just how intuitive and abstract the programming process will become as a result of the advancement of AI. In the past, programmers needed to use specific technical jargon to communicate to a computer, but AI now has the potential to generate code based on natural human language and intentions.
Humans may soon be able to communicate to computers the same way they communicate to each other, making programming and software development a skill that is much more accessible.
However, it also makes me wonder, as a computer science student who plans to go into software development and engineering, what skills I will need to acquire that set me apart from AI.
